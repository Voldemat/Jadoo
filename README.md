# Learning layoting Step 1
---

I`m worked for 2 weeks on this project.


Mistakes I`m understand during this project:
* Always start from mobile website and then make responsive to other devices.
* Previously analyze design, find similar styles, fonts, sections.
* Don`t use so much flexbox elements, it``s to hard to make them responsive.
* Separate css into more files
